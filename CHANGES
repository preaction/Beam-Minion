Changelog for Beam-Minion

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed test failures due to weakened references added in Minion
      9.07. Thanks @eserte! [Github #4]
    - Silenced a warning during tests about "Local::Service::DESTROYED"
      used only once

0.014     2018-04-21 10:29:44+02:00 Europe/Oslo

    [Fixed]

    - Increased Minion dependency to 9 since we rely on some methods for
      testing. Thanks @eserte!
    - To improve after-task cleanup, we now create and destroy
      containers during jobs, rather than caching the container (and all
      of the objects).

0.013     2018-04-19 13:30:58+02:00 Europe/Oslo

    [Fixed]

    - Task objects are now destroyed and any cleanup methods called
      correctly.

      Previously, we would cache a copy of the task object
      which would keep it alive until Minion called `POSIX::_exit(0)`.
      This was causing database connections to be closed badly, and the
      database server to complain about it.

0.011     2017-09-19 15:18:44-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

      CPANTS!

0.010     2017-09-18 14:06:38-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed job command not processing options

0.009     2017-09-18 13:25:40-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added "beam minion job" command to list jobs, retry jobs, list
      workers, and otherwise manage the job queue. This is a proxy for
      the Minion::Command::minion::job command.

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed tests that fail when BEAM_MINION environment variable is set
    - Fixed worker only loading one container file instead of all
      container files

0.008     2017-09-17 18:00:34-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed minimum version of Getopt::Long prerequisite

0.007     2017-09-17 17:54:51-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Changed]

    - The worker is now able to run tasks from all containers by
      default. This opens up Minion queues to be used for other
      purposes, such as prioritization and partitioning jobs.

    - BREAKING CHANGE: The `Beam::Minion::enqueue` method now accepts an
      arrayref of args and a hashref of options. Previously, the
      arguments were allowed as a list, but this prevented us from
      adding the options hashref.

    [Added]

    - Added options to the `beam minion run` command to set job
      auto-retry, job delay, and job priority.

    [Fixed]

    - Added better exception handling to Minion jobs. Now if the service
      dies during construction, or the `run` method throws an exception,
      the job result will reflect this and show the exception.

0.006     2017-08-22 18:48:33-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed issue with passing plain DBI DSNs: The backend expects
      a list of arguments, not an arrayref of arguments.

    - Moved log to STDERR. This is temporary until we can come up with
      some more robust logging configuration (probably Log::Any)

0.005     2017-08-19 21:42:31-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed raw Minion args to allow passing plain DBI DSNs. This allows
      me to use the `mysql_read_defaults_file` DBD::mysql configuration.

0.004     2017-08-14 13:01:07-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - Added `enqueue` Perl API to the Beam::Minion module. This makes it
      easier to add jobs via Perl instead of using the command-line (or
      the command class)

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed deprecated use of `slurp` from Mojolicious
    - Fixed some error messages to be easier to understand for the user

0.003     2017-04-28 01:26:54-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Missing BEAM_MINION environment variable now shows a more friendly
      error message

    [Added]

    - Added some basic getting started documentation in preparation for
      writing some tutorials

0.002     2017-01-15 14:15:44-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Updated prereq versions to have all the features we need

0.001     2017-01-13 20:01:57-06:00 America/Chicago

    - Initial release
